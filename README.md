# ToDoList App Swift UI

Build a full fledged iPhone app using SwiftUI, and Xcode. Next, we will integrate Google Firebase as a backend for the app. This backend will let the user Register and Log In to your new app.

We'll dive into the world of saving data into a database – to do list items – and getting the users saved information. You'll get a chance to build reusable components like headers, Calendars, buttons, and more.

Additionally, we'll get into the details of working with data in a declarative UI framework like SwiftUI. We'll leverage best practices with ViewModels, StateObjects, Bindings, and more.
